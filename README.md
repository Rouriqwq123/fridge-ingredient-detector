## 📊 Model Performance

| Model | mAP50 | mAP50-95 | Precision | Recall | FPS |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|--------|-----|
| fridge_v1 (baseline) | 51.0% | 37.0% | 68.0% | 47.0% | 49.5 |
| fridge_v12 (final) | **76.8%** | **58.6%** | **82.1%** | **76.4%** | **53.0** |

### Best Performing Classes (AP50 > 0.98)
`leek` · `spinach` · `bamboo shoots` · `kimchi` · `ham` · `mushrooms` · `bean` · `flour` · `corn` · `butter`

### Needs Improvement (AP50 < 0.15)
`longan` · `orange juice` · `green chilies` — insufficient training data (<5 samples per class)

## 📁 Dataset

### Training Data (3 sources merged)

| Dataset | Images | Classes | Source |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| Fridge Object Dataset | 7,358 | 61 | Roboflow Universe |
| Custom Annotations | 29 | 30 new | Self-labeled (Chinese ingredients) |
| Ingredients Detection YoloV8 | 47,000+ | 68 | Roboflow Universe |
| **Total** | **~54,000** | **125** | — |

### Why Custom Annotations?
The base dataset lacked Chinese-specific ingredients. I personally photographed and annotated 29 images adding categories like `tofu`, `rice`, `kimchi`, `bamboo shoots`, `pork` — common in Asian households but absent from Western datasets.

## 🔍 Key Technical Decisions

**Why YOLOv8 over other detectors?**
Single-stage detector with excellent speed/accuracy tradeoff. At 53 FPS on RTX 3050, it's real-time capable. The Ultralytics API also streamlined the full pipeline from training to deployment.

**Why Transfer Learning?**
Fine-tuning YOLOv8n pretrained on COCO achieved 76.8% mAP50 with ~45k images. Training from scratch would require millions of samples to reach comparable performance.

**Why prioritize "fewest missing ingredients" in recommendations?**
Initial version sorted by Jaccard similarity, which recommended recipes requiring many extra ingredients. Redesigned to sort by missing count first — much more practical for real cooking decisions.

**Why AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision)?**
RTX 3050 has only 4GB VRAM. AMP halves memory usage by computing in float16 where possible, allowing batch_size=8 at 640px resolution without OOM.

## 📈 Training Configuration

```python
model    = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")   # Transfer learning from COCO pretrained
epochs   = 50
imgsz    = 640
batch    = 8
device   = "cuda"               # RTX 3050 Laptop GPU (4GB)

# Key augmentation params
mosaic   = 1.0   # 4-image mosaic — handles cluttered fridge scenes
hsv_v    = 0.4   # Brightness jitter — accounts for varying fridge lighting
fliplr   = 0.5   # Horizontal flip
patience = 20    # Early stopping to prevent overfitting
```
